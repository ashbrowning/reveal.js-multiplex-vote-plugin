# reveal.js multiplex-vote

A plugin for [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) that adds interactive voting to presentations.

When a voting section in the main presentation is displayed, the client presentation displays the voting
options, with submitted votes being displayed in realtime on the main presentation.
